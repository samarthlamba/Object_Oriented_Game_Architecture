### Project goals
We have decided to create Scrolling Platformer games. Our goal is to generate 3 different types of single player games that use similar platform logic to traverse a map. The map can be infinite or finite based on player's choosing.


### Project Emphasis
The main emphasis of the project will be on functionality and reuseability (ie design). We want to create something where the basic code can be reused multiple times to create different variations. The idea is to have the character stay in the same location on the screen and the "world" to change around it. We want to spend more time on the functionality and reuseability and slightly less time on the visuals/initial configurations.

### Project Progress

#### Sprint 1 (test)
Strong progress idea:
Basic Mario style platform (jumping, obstacles, fixed finish line, etc.)
UI starts game. Basic infrastructure created

#### Sprint 2 (Basic)
Strong progress idea:
Hack and slash style, player has an action to take against enemies 
Multiple Level formats
UI: level selection, pause, and basic player interaction

#### Sprint 3 (Complete)
Strong progress idea:
Gimmick style: player has one specialized action to use to progress through level
ability to change controls: keys to move, action key
Infinite mode: automatically generates obstacles randomly. Potentially with a weight of increased difficulty.

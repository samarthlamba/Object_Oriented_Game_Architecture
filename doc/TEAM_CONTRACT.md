# Example Team Contract

### As a project team, we promise to:
 * respect each other's ideas and work.
 * communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.
 * come to meetings on time

### If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
 * have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement.
 * report the issue in the Team Sprint Report.
 * Others based on your team discussion

### Team Procedures:
 * Day, time, and place for regular team meetings (not necessarily with the client)

 * Preferred method of communication (e.g., e-mail, cell phone, Facebook, Slack, face-to-face, etc.)

    Group text, within 24hrs but preferrably sooner

   Let people know if there are major changes or updates

   Let us know before you merge something non-trivial

   Save huge design decisions for meetings

 * Missing meetings

   Reach out as much beforehand as possible to let us know you'll miss a meeting

   Try to fill us in anyway on how your part of the project is going

   The rest of the team: communicate to the person who missed what was said

 * Decision-making policy (e.g., by consensus? by majority vote?)
    
    General Concensus, each person responsible for one task
 * Method for setting and following meeting agendas (how will items get on each agenda? by when? reminders? keeping meetings on track?)

    At weekly meetings, each person reports what they need to do and they keep track of them
